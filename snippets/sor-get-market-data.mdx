## 1. Get Market Data (Optional)

<Tip>

Functionality not implemented. Use existing [v2 Market Date][v2-market-date] instead.

</Tip>

Access the [Market Data][market-data] service to get the latest available prices for the assets you want to buy or sell.
The default markets include:

| Query Parameter | Possible Values | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `market` | `ETHUSD` `BTCUSD` `BCHUSD` `LTCUSD` `LINKUSD` `MATICUSD` `AAVEUSD` `UNIUSD` | Available markets. |
| `level` | `L1` `L2` `L3` | Specify how the order should be treated.<br/>`L1` = The best Bid and Ask prices for the Market.<br/>`L2` = Bid and Ask prices at all levels.<br/>`L3` = Bid and Ask prices at all levels broken out by order. |
| `venues` | `all` | Check all available venues for the best price. Support for venue selection not enabled. |

<Warning>

Market orders are executed at the best available price and may get executed at a less or more favorable price than originally intended.

</Warning>

To get the latest pricing data for a market, use the `order_book` endpoint and pass in the appropriate values for `market`, `level` and `venues`. To check the order book for `BTCUSD`, use the following:

```shell
curl --location "https://api.sandbox.paxos.com/v2/trading/order_book?market=BTCUSD&level=L1&venues=all" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"

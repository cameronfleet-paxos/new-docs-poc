Most API endpoints require authentication with a **Client ID** and **Secret**.
Each **Client ID** has a specific set of allowed scopes (**Permissions**) to access API endpoints.
Scopes allowed on an API client may be updated at any time in the Dashboard **Admin > API Management** section.

> Contact your [Entity Manager] if you need permissions to manage API credentials.

When setting scopes, we recommend following the [principle of least privilege][wiki] and only allow scopes required by a specific application.
Scopes for each endpoint are listed in the **Authorizations** section in the [API Reference docs](/api/v2).
The [Market Data](/api-reference/Market-Data) and most [Pricing](/api-reference/Pricing) endpoints do not require authorization.

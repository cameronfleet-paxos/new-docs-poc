The BalanceType field indicates which specific balance the row is referring to.
It provides a way to precisely follow movement of funds as transactions complete in the [Profile Transaction Report](#ProfileTransactionReport), and identify the volume of funds held in reserve or in pending transactions at the end of each day in the [Profile Balances Report](#ProfileBalancesReport).

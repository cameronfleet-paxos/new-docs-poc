In the reports, the Profile's starting balance is impacted by any associated Profile Transaction, and results in the corresponding Profile end balance.

- If a Profile has ever held a given asset at any point in the past, zero balances will be explicitly printed. For example, if Profile 1 held Bitcoin in the past, but not today, Profile Balances will appear as “BTC: 0”.
- If a Profile has never held an asset at any point in the past, zero balances will not be explicitly printed. For example, if Profile 1 has never held Bitcoin in the past, Profile Balances will not appear for the BTC asset at all.

Reports are in UTC 0 time, and have an exact hour cutoff for the UTC timezone indicated when [activating reporting](#activate).
Paxos delivers reports one time per day and does not support multiple cutoff times or changes to the pre-configured cutoff time.

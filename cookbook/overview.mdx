Welcome to the Paxos Cookbook! This section provides step-by-step recipes for common integration patterns. Each recipe is designed to be concise, actionable, and easy to follow.

## What are Recipes?

Recipes are focused, practical guides that walk you through completing specific tasks with the Paxos platform. Unlike comprehensive guides, recipes:

- Focus on a single, well-defined outcome
- Provide clear, sequential steps
- Include all necessary code snippets
- Minimize background explanation in favor of action

## Available Recipes

### Identity & Onboarding
- [Create Identity for Brokerage Enrollment](/cookbook/create-identity-brokerage) - Set up a Person Identity, Account, and Profile for crypto brokerage services

## Recipe Structure

Each recipe follows a consistent structure:

1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Step-by-step instructions** - Clear, sequential actions
3. **Code examples** - Copy-paste ready snippets
4. **Result verification** - How to confirm success
5. **Next steps** - Logical follow-up actions

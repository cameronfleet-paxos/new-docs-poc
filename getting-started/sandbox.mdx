The Developer Sandbox replicates core API functionality with an automated system that uses test funds to simulate normal activities, including a few Sandbox-only endpoints.

<Tip>
To start using the Sandbox environment, create a Developer account in the dashboard.

## Sandbox Testnets and Devnets

When you use the Create Sandbox Deposit endpoint to fund a Profile, the platform creates the asset on the testing network.
The asset can then be transferred to any off-platform address that supports the test network.
Similarly, when using the create deposit address endpoint in Sandbox, the generated address can be used to transfer test assets to the Paxos platform.

| Crypto Network | Supported Testnet/Devnet |
| --- | --- |
| Arbitrum One | Sepolia |
| Bitcoin | Testnet3 |
| Bitcoin Cash | Testnet |
| Ethereum | Sepolia |
| Litecoin | Testnet |
| Polygon POS | Sepolia |
| Solana | Devnet |

## Sandbox Identity Testing

When testing the Identity APIs in Sandbox, you may be blocked by a verification process.
If this is the case, use the Sandbox Set Identity Status endpoint to change `id_verification_status` and `sanctions_verification_status` to "APPROVED" and enable an individual identity to transact during Sandbox testing.
To enable the Institution to transact during Sandbox testing, set `sanctions_verification_status` to "APPROVED".

## Sandbox Fiat Transfer Testing

To test Fiat Transfers API in Sandbox, the Initiate Sandbox Fiat Deposit endpoint starts test fiat deposit that will be processed based on the `memo_id` from a previous Fiat Deposit Instructions response.

<Warning>
When [creating API credentials](credentials) via the Dashboard, the `transfer:write_sandbox_fiat_deposit` scope may not appear in the UI.
Including the scope when [authenticating](authenticate) may result in an `invalid_scope` error.
Contact Support if you run into any issues using this scope.
</Warning>

<Tip>
You need API credentials to authenticate with the Paxos APIs. Follow these steps to create your credentials in the dashboard.
</Tip>

1. Go to **Admin > API Management** to add new credentials.
2. Create a **Label** for your API credentials and select the **Scopes** for your **Client ID**. For example, the following scopes (space delimited) should be adequate to mint, redeem and convert Paxos-issued stablecoins.
3. Save the credentials.
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and store them in a safe place. The secret will not be displayed in the UI again and will have to be reset if forgotten.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, you can [authenticate](authenticate).
